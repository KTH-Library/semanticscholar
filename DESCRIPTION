Description: Semantic Scholar is a free, non-profit, AI-powered academic search and 
    discovery engine whose mission is to empower researchers. It can be used as a 
    research tool for scientific literature available and is available at

    to Semantic Scholar pages and pulling information about individual records on demand. 
    This R package wraps the lightweight API in order to facilitate on demand access
